# My Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases some of the projects i've done while learning how to code.

# About Me
I graduated in Environmental Engineering and worked in the field for 3 years. 
Through friends and my interest for technology, I started learning web development, which led me to my current path.
I am still a beginner in the area, but I have an ambitious mindset to learn and adquire experience, which hopefully one day can lead me to blend this new skill with my background in Environmental Engineering.
